.SYNOPSIS
    Covers build-dev.ps1's -SkipRuntime switch, its mutual exclusion with -SkipSatellites, and the
    DLL-lock preflight added in 7b3fe811 (#849).

.DESCRIPTION
    The preflight exists because the staged base dbatools.dll cannot be replaced while any live
    process has it loaded, and long-lived pwsh 7 windows import the core drop straight out of
    artifacts. That failure used to surface as a bare Copy-Item error AFTER a multi-minute build and
    was misread as a library-edit-lease conflict, which it never was.

    Everything runs against a disposable SANDBOX built by BuildDevTestSupport.ps1 (split out only to
    stay under the 400-line limit; it holds no assertions). That is what makes the important leg
    possible - the real script invoked with the staged DLL genuinely locked, asserted to abort before
    any dotnet invocation - without locking the shared artifacts drop or compiling anything. The
    sandbox is uniquely named and removed in a finally, so concurrent runs cannot collide.

    Every lock assertion checks BOTH directions. A check that can only answer "locked" is as broken
    as one that can only answer "free".

    -IncludeBuild adds the end-to-end leg that runs -SkipRuntime against the REAL tree and proves
    the staged base DLL is untouched. It is opt-in because it compiles every satellite and writes
    into artifacts: TAKE THE LIBRARY EDIT LEASE FIRST, or it races a gate and both results become
    meaningless.

.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/test-build-dev-skipruntime.ps1

    Runs the hermetic legs. Exit 0 = green.

.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/test-build-dev-skipruntime.ps1 -IncludeBuild

    Adds the end-to-end -SkipRuntime build. Hold the library edit lease when you use this.

.OUTPUTS
    None. Writes leg results to the host; exit code 0 = all legs green.
