/// <summary>
/// Gets databases from one or more SQL Server instances, with rich filtering. Port of
/// public/Get-DbaDatabase.ps1 (W3-027, WAVE-3 remnant); the workflow remains a module-scoped
/// PowerShell compatibility hop. READ-ONLY (no SupportsShouldProcess).
///
/// BEGIN+PROCESS. -SqlInstance is Mandatory ValueFromPipeline, so process fires per piped instance.
///
/// NO CROSS-RECORD VALUE CARRY, and NO begin -> process value carry - established by triage, not
/// assumed. begin (:244-250) holds only one guard. The three Find-ConditionalCarry candidates were
/// all REFUTED before coding:
///   $pattern - the "foreach ($pattern ...)" loop variable INSIDE the $matchesPattern scriptblock
///     (:357-366); the reads at :370/:393/:403 are the PARAMETER $Pattern (capital P). A detector
///     case-insensitivity false positive, not a carry.
///   $NoLogBackupSince - defaulted at :427-428 only when empty, to "New-Object DateTime" (DateTime
///     .MinValue) + 1ms - a DETERMINISTIC value, so re-computing it per record is idempotent and
///     equals what a carry would hold. No carry.
///   $hasCopyOnly - assigned at :421 inside "if ($NoFullBackup -or $NoFullBackupSince)" (:413) and
///     read at :506 inside the SAME "if ($NoFullBackup -or $NoFullBackupSince)"; both are non-pipeline
///     parameters, constant across records, so it is always-assigned-before-read or never-read - the
///     W2-155 $deploymentReport constant-gate pattern. No carry.
///   $server (codex r1 raised it; REFUTED) - assigned in the connection try (:256), whose catch
///     (:258) is Stop-Function -Continue. The "foreach ($instance in $SqlInstance)" loop opens at
///     :254 and CLOSES at :537, wrapping the whole body, so every $server read (:298/:327/.../:355
///     Invoke-QueryRawDatabases) is a STATEMENT AFTER that catch, inside the loop. The catch's
///     -Continue issues "continue", which is dynamically scoped and unwinds that foreach, so on a
///     connection failure those reads are UNREACHABLE - no stale cross-record $server is observed.
///     The settled continue-in-catch class (read AFTER a -Continue catch is unreachable on failure);
///     measured in migration/logs/probe-20260718-continue-propagation.
///
/// UNBOUND [datetime] SEMANTICS (codex r1, real fix). The source's -NoFullBackupSince and
/// -NoLogBackupSince are $null when the caller omits them; a non-nullable C# DateTime property is
/// MinValue instead, which is TRUTHY in PowerShell - it would wrongly enable the :413 backup filter
/// and defeat the :426 "if (!$NoLogBackupSince)" default init. So the property stays DateTime (the
/// surface is unchanged), but ProcessRecord passes $null into the hop when the parameter was NOT
/// bound (the two inner hop params are received UNTYPED so $null survives), and the real value -
/// including an explicitly-passed MinValue - when it was.
///
/// The query helper functions Invoke-QueryDBlastUsed (:297), Invoke-QueryRawDatabases (:325),
/// Invoke-QueryDatabaseSizes (:467) and the $matchesPattern scriptblock (:357) are all defined IN
/// PROCESS, so they ride verbatim in the process hop - no begin -> process recreation needed.
///
/// INTERRUPT CARRIES ON BOTH AXES, bridged conservatively. begin's only guard (:246, ExcludeUser +
/// ExcludeSystem) is Stop-Function -Continue and so does NOT set the module latch (a latent source
/// quirk - the guard warns but does not actually halt). The LIVE latch source is process: the
/// non-Continue "Stop-Function -Message 'Failure' -ErrorRecord $_" at :351 (a catch with NO following
/// return, inside Invoke-QueryRawDatabases called from the instance loop) sets the latch mid-record,
/// and process opens with "if (Test-FunctionInterrupt) { return }" at :252, so a Failure on one
/// record silences later records. The begin hop and each process hop read the latch at
/// Get-Variable -Scope 0 and carry it; a persisted C# _interrupted field bridges it across records.
/// Mechanism measured in migration/logs/probe-20260718-latch-sentinel.
///
/// ONE Test-Bound ("Encrypted" at :321, "$Encrypt = switch (Test-Bound -Parameter 'Encrypted')")
/// becomes a carried boundness flag $__boundEncrypted. The nine switches (ExcludeUser, ExcludeSystem,
/// Encrypted, NoFullBackup, NoLogBackup, IncludeLastUsed, OnlyAccessible) and inherited
/// EnableException cross as SwitchParameter OBJECTS received untyped. -ExcludeUser and -ExcludeSystem
/// carry their aliases. In-hop Stop-Function/Write-Message calls carry -FunctionName. Positions 0-10
/// are made explicit per the W2-071 law and confirmed against the exported baseline; SqlInstance is
/// Mandatory VFP at 0. Streaming (DEF-001): emits per database. Surface pinned by
/// migration/baselines/Get-DbaDatabase.json.
