    /// -ErrorVariable list with the hop-era records afterwards. Records are appended directly —
    /// NOT via WriteError — because the function world never displays or preference-processes
    /// these records either; their only caller-visible effect is variable capture, and $Error
    /// itself is already correct (the hop shares the runspace).

    /// record is known and skippable; the dominant DEF-013 mechanism (Stop-Function -Continue
