/// <summary>
/// Removes orphaned users, re-owning or dropping the schemas they own first. Port of
/// public/Remove-DbaDbOrphanUser.ps1; the workflow remains a module-scoped PowerShell compatibility
/// hop.
///
/// The hop runs once PER INSTANCE. The source foreaches $SqlInstance and keeps no cross-instance
/// state in that loop, so the split is safe; Unlike Set-DbaDbQueryStoreOption there is no pre-loop
/// guard here, so it needs no run-once machinery either - the process body IS the instance loop.
/// An earlier revision of this comment justified the split by claiming a single whole-array hop would
/// "emit all verbose ahead of all results". That was WRONG and is retracted: InvokeScopedStreaming
/// streams, so records surface in production order either way. The split is retained because it
/// bounds each instance's failure to its own invocation, not for any ordering reason.
///
/// The source's begin block does TWO things - "if ($Force) { $ConfirmPreference = 'none' }" and an
/// $eol constant - and both fold into the top of the hop, since -Force is not a pipeline parameter
/// and setting the preference per invocation is identical to setting it once. That fold is sound because a
/// $ConfirmPreference set inside the hop still reaches a gate routed to the outer cmdlet -
/// ShouldProcess resolves the preference from the scope chain at call time, measured separately with
/// a failing control.
///
/// All FIVE ShouldProcess gates are routed to the OUTER cmdlet ($Pscmdlet becomes $__realCmdlet),
/// which keeps -Confirm's "Yes to All" answer alive across pipeline records rather than letting a
/// per-record inner runtime forget it. (Counted mechanically, not by eye: an earlier revision of this
/// comment said three.)
///
/// No local needs a cross-record carry, and the accumulators are the part worth checking rather than
/// assuming: $AlterSchemaOwner and $DropSchema are built with += and read together to compose the
/// DROP USER batch, which is exactly the shape that forced guarded carries on other rows. Both are
/// reset to "" INSIDE the per-user loop that consumes them, immediately before the appends, so
/// nothing leaks between users or databases. $db, $DatabaseCollection, $dbuser, $ExistLogin and
/// $query are each assigned and read within one iteration, and $server is assigned at the top of the
/// instance loop whose failure path is Stop-Function -Continue, which skips every remaining statement
/// of that iteration including the reads.
///
/// No graceful-stop latch: the source has no Test-FunctionInterrupt guard, so a later record simply
/// re-enters the process body. Carrying a latch would suppress output the function repeats.
///
/// Note that BOTH -SqlInstance and -User are ValueFromPipeline. That does not change the hop
/// design - each binds per record as usual - but it means a caller can pipe either, and the
/// per-instance split is over whatever -SqlInstance holds for the current record.
///
/// $StackSource IS HOP-SAFE, and this is worth recording because it looks like it should not be. The
/// body calls Get-PSCallStack and branches on the CALLER's identity: a call from Repair-DbaDbOrphanUser
/// trusts the -User collection it was handed, anything else goes and discovers users itself. A hop
/// inserts extra scriptblock frames, so this is the same family as Test-Bound - a guard that inspects
/// the very thing the hop changes - and it was reported as a defect on review.
///
/// It is not one, and the reason is the indexing: $CallStack[$CallStack.Count - 2] counts from the
/// BOTTOM of the stack while the hop's frames are added at the TOP. Measured rather than argued -
/// the function shape resolves "Repair-DbaDbOrphanUser" through frames
/// <ScriptBlock> <- Remove-DbaDbOrphanUser <- Repair-DbaDbOrphanUser <- script, and the hop shape
/// resolves the SAME value through three additional inner <ScriptBlock> frames. Had the source used
/// (Get-PSCallStack)[1] - top-relative, as Get-DbaDbBackupHistory does - it WOULD have broken, and
/// that command is not yet ported. Anyone porting it should treat this as a live hazard.
///
/// The hop streams rather than buffers. This command MUTATES server state (schema re-ownership and DROP USER).
/// Note precisely what a streamed object does and does not mean here: the schema-action objects are
/// emitted BEFORE the final ExecuteNonQuery that applies the batch, so an emitted record reports
/// intent, not a completed repair - a later declined gate or a failed execution can leave an emitted
/// object whose mutation never landed. Streaming is still correct, because buffering would discard
/// the record of everything that DID complete when a later database throws under -EnableException;
/// but an earlier revision of this comment claimed emitted objects "record completed repairs", and
/// that overstated it.
///
/// TWO KNOWN SHARED-RUNTIME GAPS, held for the consolidated fix rather than worked around here.
///
/// First, warnings raised by NESTED calls are lost: the function emits a Connect-DbaInstance
/// connection warning and its own Stop-Function warning, and this port emits only the second, in both
/// warning modes. The mechanism I originally proposed - "compiled nested cmdlets bypass the 3>&1
/// merge" - is NOT well supported and should not be repeated as fact. PSCmdlet.WriteWarning produces
/// an ordinary stream-3 WarningRecord, which the redirection and the demultiplexer both handle, so
/// "the child is compiled" cannot by itself be the cause; a real bypass would need direct host/UI
/// writes, a separate pipeline or runspace, or a different code path in the child. The MEASUREMENT
/// stands and the diagnosis does not.
///
/// Second - and this is the sharper form of the -WarningAction gap - preference values of Stop are
/// not propagated INTO the hop at all. The source applies -WarningAction / -ErrorAction Stop inside
/// its own try blocks, where a Stop is caught and handled. In the port the records are merged and
/// re-emitted from the streaming callback, so a Stop fires OUTSIDE the original catch boundary. That
/// is not merely a lost warning: it changes where termination happens and therefore which side
/// effects have already been applied when it does. This command re-owns schemas and drops users, so
/// the distinction is a real one for a caller.
