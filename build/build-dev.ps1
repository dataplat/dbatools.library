# Fast per-iteration dev build for the libmigration campaign (migration PHASE-0 row P0-004).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: build/build.ps1 -CoreOnly is NOT a fast path - by the time it returns it has
# already run dotnet clean, then dotnet publish --self-contained for net472 AND net8.0, then a
# release build of every satellite. That is minutes per iteration. This script instead REUSES the
# heavy dependency tree (SMO, SqlClient, DacFx, Bogus, native runtimes) already staged by a prior
# full build under artifacts/dbatools.library, and recompiles only the two thin things a port
# iteration actually changes: the shared runtime dbatools.dll and the satellite cmdlet assemblies.
# An incremental dotnet build (no clean, no publish, no self-contained) rebuilds only what changed.
#
# DEFAULT is core-only (net8.0) for speed. Pass -IncludeDesktop to also refresh the net472 drop,
# which the acceptance check and any Windows PowerShell 5.1 gate need. Pass -SkipSatellites to
# refresh only the runtime dll (fastest; use only when you did not touch a satellite).
#
# -SkipRuntime is the inverse: refresh only the satellites, leaving the staged base dbatools.dll
# alone. Use it when you touched a satellite and NOT dbatools/ - the common case for a port
# iteration. It exists because the base drop cannot be re-staged at all while any live session has
# it loaded (see the holder check below), and that blocked satellite-only work that never needed
# the base refreshed (#849).
#
# It does NOT rely on anything downstream to catch skew, and an earlier version of this comment was
# wrong to say it did: every satellite csproj carries <ProjectReference Include="..\dbatools\
# dbatools.csproj" />, so building a satellite recompiles the runtime into artifacts/lib/Release/
# whether or not -SkipRuntime was passed - it is only the STAGING that is skipped. The gate's
# base-library parity guard hashes the two STAGED copies (guest vs host,
# migration/tools/Test-GateBaseLibraryPrecondition.ps1), and staging is exactly the step that did
# not run, so both sides read the same stale file and the guard passes on skewed bits (#854). The
# post-build content check at the bottom of this script is therefore the only thing that sees it.
#
# ACCEPTANCE (P0-004): after `build-dev.ps1 -IncludeDesktop`, Use-LocalDbatoolsLibrary -Validate is
# green (both editions import warning-clean) because the dependency tree is reused untouched and
# only dbatools.dll is refreshed.
#
# PREREQUISITE: a full drop must exist under artifacts/dbatools.library (run build/build.ps1 once
# to seed it). This script deliberately does NOT rebuild the dependency tree - that is the whole
# source of its speed - so it fails fast and loud if the base drop is missing rather than silently
# emitting an unloadable runtime with no dependencies.
